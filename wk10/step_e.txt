Was only able to figure out how to do the path traversal:
<?php
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
ini_set('display_startup_errors', 1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);

$allowed_directory = 'html';
$path = isset($_GET['q']) ? $_GET['q'] : '.';
$absolute_path = realpath($path);

$basename = basename($absolute_path);

if ($basename === $allowed_directory || strpos($absolute_path, $allowed_directory . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR) === 0) {
    if (!file_exists($absolute_path)) {
        echo "Invalid directory or file.";
        exit;
    }

    print "<pre>";
    print_r(scandir($absolute_path));
    print "</pre>";
} else {
    echo "Not valid entry";
}
?>

Had to check if the current directory is within the allowed directry which is html and below and not any of the directories before it.
by using the basename() I was able to check if the directory is valid from the absolute path and that anything
below the allowed directory would not be able to be accecssed. 

Was not able to figure out how to get it to not look at folders that do not exists.
